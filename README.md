# TriangleSplattingOFFBlenderImporter
This is a script that will bring in the provided off example files from the triangle splatting team to blender as vertex colors.

Most of this code was generated by ChatGPT since I wasn't familar with the off file format and didn't want to learn about it to write the importer.  It successfully created a one shot importer for non-vertex colored off files, although I modified the vertex color supported one to work with the off files provided by the Triange Splatting team.  This may only work with the off format structure used by the triangle splatting project, although feel free to try it with other off files.

Make sure to replace with your own path to the off file.
